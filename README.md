## Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Load and preprocess various file formats directly using PyTorch
- Perform essential tensor manipulations for data preparation and model operations
- Compute and interpret key evaluation metrics for different ML tasks
- Integrate these fundamentals into a cohesive data processing pipeline

## Session Content

### 1. Check-in + Session 8 Recap (15 minutes)
- Quick review of YOLO and multi-object detection concepts
- Discussion of any challenges from the previous homework
- Overview of today's back-to-basics approach

### 2. Data Loading from Disk: Beyond Datasets (30 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Direct file I/O with PyTorch tensors
- Preprocessing pipelines for different data types
- Memory-efficient loading strategies

**Example Script Overview:**
We'll explore loading CSV files, images, and custom binary formats directly into tensors with appropriate preprocessing.

### 3. Tensor Operations Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Tensor creation and initialization methods
- Stacking, concatenation, and reshaping operations
- Broadcasting and element-wise operations
- Memory layout considerations

**Hands-on Practice:**
Working through common tensor manipulation scenarios you'll encounter in real projects.

### 4. Break & Discussion (10 minutes)

### 5. Metrics Computation & Evaluation (25 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Classification metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Regression metrics: MSE, MAE, RÂ²
- Custom metric implementation
- Batch-wise vs. epoch-wise computation

### 6. Integration Exercise & Wrap-up (10 minutes)
- Combining all concepts in a mini-project
- Q&A and preparation for next session
